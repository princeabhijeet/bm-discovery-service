# If client service wants to communicate with another client service,
# it will first have to fetch registry stored in Eureka discovery service.
# Hence fetch-registry is set to true in properties of client microservices 
# whereas fetch-registry is set to false in case of eureka service as 
# eureka server itself holds all the client services registry 
# and it does not need to fetch them with itself. 
# If we still set fetch-registry=true for discovery service, 
# we will get connection exception in console logs but discovery service will still be up.
eureka.client.fetch-registry=false

# Eureka server has a built-in Eureka client also. As in production, 
# generally there is a cluster of Eureka servers and they register among themselves as client. 
# But we are running the server on the localhost and we donâ€™t need a cluster. 
# So we need to switch off the client's behavior so that it doesn't try to register itself. 
# If we still set it to true we will get conection refused in console logs but discovery server will stil be up.
eureka.client.register-with-eureka=false

# Default zone URL is service URL of eureka server itself. If we change the default port of eureka server from 8761 to 5555 
# and do not specify defaultZone URL and check UI of localhost:5555 (we changed port from 8761 to 5555), 
# we will see that in General Info section, registered-replicas and unavailable-replicas URLs still shows http://localhost:8761/eureka/ (that is on port 8761). 
# This is only visual discrepancy. Eureka server is correctly up and running on port 5555. 
# To correct this (to http://localhost:8761/eureka/), we specify this default zone URL.
